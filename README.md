# NOTICE: Project Under Massive Rework
I've begun of this project, and so most of the old legacy code for this project needed to go. If you are interested in seeing what this looked like before I deleted everything and started over, look at [#6dbe3c7]([url](https://github.com/DavJCosby/sled/tree/6dbe3c7da6447125dbd71a01ba61078b83073945))

# Why Start Over?
Lots of reasons are outlined in more detail on [this](https://github.com/DavJCosby/sled/issues/2) post, but in short:
- This was my first "big" rust project, so there were a lot of bad design decisions made early on
- I wanted to change the name from slc (Spatial Lighting Controller) to sled (Spatial LED)
